# Summary
Helps you play wordle.

# Building
You need Node and Go to build the wordle helper.

```
pnpm i
pnpm build
```
You are recommended to use pnpm, but you can use npm as well.

# Developing
I use ninja for development and watchexec for watching files. Ninja helps to track built dependencies so we don't have to do full rebuilds all the time
